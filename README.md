# UNC Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description

This is my submittion for the first challenge of the UNC Bootcamp for full-stack web development. This challenge involved refactoring existing 
code for a fictional organization in order to meet website accessibility requirements. I was able to practice fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Git
in order to meet the acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
